/* 
Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being 
specified so it knows how to work with that data. Weâ€™ll look at two data type subsets: 
scalar and compound.

!Scalar types
A scalar type represents a single value. 
Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, 
floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. 
You may recognize these from other programming languages. 
Letâ€™s jump into how they work in Rust.

!Integers types


Length	Signed	Unsigned
8-bit	i8	      u8
16-bit	i16	      u16
32-bit	i32	      u32
64-bit	i64	      u64
128-bit	i128	  u128
arch	isize	  usize
